            <li>We will provide parents or guardians with <strong>direct notice</strong> of the information We collect from their children, how We use it, and how it may be disclosed.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Parental Rights Under COPPA</h3>
          <p>
            As a parent or guardian, You have the right to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Review</strong> the Personal Data We have collected from Your child.</li>
            <li><strong>Revoke Your consent</strong> for the further collection, use, or disclosure of Your child's Personal Data.</li>
            <li><strong>Request the deletion</strong> of Your child's Personal Data.</li>
            <li><strong>Refuse</strong> to permit the Company to collect any further Personal Data from Your child, while still allowing Your child to access the portions of the Service that do not require such information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To exercise any of these rights concerning your child's account, please contact Us using the "Contact Us" details provided below. We will take steps to verify your identity as the child's parent or guardian before fulfilling any request.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Collection and Use</h3>
          <p>
            The information collected from children will be the same types of data collected from other users (e.g., Email address, Usage Data, Pictures and other information from your Device's camera and photo library), and it will be used <strong>only</strong> for the purposes disclosed in the "Use of Your Personal Data" section, which are necessary to operate and improve the Service.
          </p>

          <h3>Global Parental Consent</h3>
          <p>
            If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your child's information and Your country (outside of the US, such as those subject to GDPR) requires consent from a parent for users under a certain age, <strong>We may require Your parent's consent</strong> before We collect and use that information.
